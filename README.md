# Anki Zero: Never miss your reviews again - or else ðŸ’¸

Anki's value add is all in the reviews, yet all too often we let ourselves procrastinate
on the most important part of the whole program. Not anymore! **Anki Zero** is a
simple plugin to integrate Anki with Beeminder, with one goal in mind: **If you
don't complete your "Due" and "Learning" columns, you get charged a fine.**

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to start using the Anki to Beeminder Sync Plugin:

1. **Create a Beeminder "Whittle Down" Goal called `anki-zero`:** Before you begin, create a "Whittle Down" goal in your Beeminder account. Name the goal `anki-zero` to represent your Anki progress tracking.

2. **Install the Plugin:** Install the Anki to Beeminder Sync Plugin by adding it to your Anki addons. You can do this by going to the "Tools" menu in Anki, selecting "Add-ons," and then choosing "Get Add-ons." Enter the addon code [ADDON_CODE_HERE] to install the plugin.

3. **Configure the Plugin:** Open your Anki personal configuration file and add the following information:

```json
{
  "beeminder_username": "user123",
  "beeminder_personal_auth_token": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"
}
```

Replace `"user123"` with your Beeminder username and `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"` with your Beeminder personal authentication token. (You can find this token under "Account Settings" -> "Apps & API".) This information is crucial for securely connecting your Anki and Beeminder accounts.

4. **Manual Sync:** To ensure everything is set up correctly, navigate to the "Tools" menu in Anki and select "Anki Zero Manual Sync." This action will initiate a synchronization of your Anki due data points to your specified Beeminder goal. You can use this feature to verify that the plugin is working as intended.
